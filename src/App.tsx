    content: "Don't know if you know this, but I was so nervous and cautious of what I should say and I felt like you could tell as well, I didn't exactly know the age gap, so I assumed that you were around Ese's age, so because of that I didn't exactly know how to relate to you"

    content: "I have no idea how it happened up till now, it just seems like a mystery to me, I sha remember it being on a Wednesday, that day we were supposed to fast and you were supposed to go out, but you ended up not going at all because Daddy said there was something to handle. You saw me with my laptop and decided to tag along with yours. I don't even know how you managed to do it, but you made me feel more comfortable than my own cousins that I've been with since. From that day, I knew there was something good coming out of this"

    title: "The Realization",
    content: "I had been watching you, but I tried to kill those feelings â€” after all, I had once said I had something for your sister. But on one faithful Saturday, everything shifted. Me and Stephanie were headed to rehearsals, and I was just listening to music. Then you sang 'Pretty Little Fears'. That moment? That moment hit me different. I realized maybeâ€¦ I had been looking at the wrong sister all along."

    number: 5,
    title: "Closer than ever",
    content: "You showed me those texts with your friendsâ€¦ Thatâ€™s when I knew â€” you liked me. But I didnâ€™t want to assume until I heard it from you directly. Around that time, we became very close â€” staying up past 1 a.m., supposedly working. Even Stephanie and Pearl were suspecting I liked you. Spoiler alert: they werenâ€™t wrong."

    title: "The Hardest Part",
    content: "This was the hardest part of our story. That whole confrontation with Stephanie? Yeah, it shook things up. You, being the mature one, said we couldnâ€™t work out. I was almost convincedâ€¦ ready to give up. But then I texted Mr. 'Rome wasnâ€™t built in a city', and he told me that if I really like you, I should fight for you. And I wasnâ€™t ready to let you go."
  },
  {
    number: 7,
    title: "Waiting and Wondering",
    content: "Basically, after all the convincing we finally did work out, but some people didn't want to date until they moved out. So I waited, I was happy enough knowing that you liked me and the possibility of us dating after you move out, but boy oh boy, did this period also come with drama as well, I legit thought that we wouldn't work from here on, because it was as if I always found one new way to make you angry and I felt really bad and I actually thought that it was unfair to force my thoughts on you even when you were skeptical about this relationship in the first place. But with the power of saying sorry repeatedly and your forgiving spirit we made it out of this phase"
